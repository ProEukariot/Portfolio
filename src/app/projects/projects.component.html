                        <p>
                            The Sticky Notes Todo app is a web application I developed this using Angular to help users
                            organize tasks visually. Users can create, edit, and delete sticky notes, with features like
                            drag-and-drop and layering for prioritization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I crafted a dynamic and responsive frontend that makes adding, editing and
                            organizing notes a breeze. The app leverages Angular's powerful features to keep everything
                            running smoothly and efficiently. Styling the app with SCSS allowed me to add a nice visual
                            style and keep the interface clean and modern.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TypeScript was my choice for adding type safety and making the codebase reliable and
                            maintainable. This made it easier to find bugs and made the development process much more
                            enjoyable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is a great example of how Angular can be used to create a practical, everyday
                            tool.
                            It's all about combining functionality with a little fun and style. Give it a try and see
                            how it
                            can help you manage your tasks!

                        <p>
                            Welcome to my latest development, a dynamic 3D marketplace application that reimagines the
                            way
                            users interact with digital assets. This project is built using a robust technology stack
                            that
                            includes Angular and TypeScript at its core, leveraging the full set of features these
                            frameworks offer for seamless development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I integrated Material UI and TailwindCSS to create an elegant and responsive UI, ensuring
                            that
                            the visuals are as captivating as the 3D models themselves. Speaking of 3D, I used ThreeJS
                            to
                            create an immersive, interactive dimension in the marketplace, allowing users to explore
                            products in a truly immersive way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the backend, NestJS and TypeORM provide a solid foundation, while SQL Server takes care
                            of
                            the database needs. Authentication is secure, keeping user data safe, and payment processing
                            is
                            a breeze thanks to Stripe integration. To make the application scalable and efficient, Azure
                            blob storage is used to handle all media assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I didn't stop there. The app has advanced filtering options that allow users to easily find
                            exactly what they are looking for. To keep things running smoothly, RxJS is used to manage
                            asynchronous data streams.

                            This project demonstrates my ability to combine different technologies to create a
                            functional,

                        <h3>Expense Tracker</h3>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to my simple expense tracker! I built this great tool using React, Bootstrap and
                            TypeScript to keep your finances in order. The idea was to create an easy-to-use interface
                            where
                            you can easily track your expenses and manage your budget.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            React provides the interface, making the application dynamic and responsive. I've used
                            Bootstrap
                            for styling, which makes sure everything looks crisp and works well across devices. The
                            layout
                            is simple and intuitive, making it easy to add, edit and view your expenses.<br /><br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TypeScript was an important part of the development process, adding type safety and
                            increasing
                            code reliability. This helped me catch bugs early and made the program more reliable
                            overall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project highlights my ability to create practical applications that are both functional
                            and
                            user-friendly. It combines the core features of React with the elegant design of Bootstrap
                            and
                            the reliability of TypeScript. Dive in and see how easy managing your expenses can be!

                            Introducing my simple food ordering app built with Angular and TypeScript! This app was
                            designed
                            to make ordering your favorite dishes an easy experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using Angular, I developed a smooth and responsive interface that makes menu navigation and
                            ordering a real pleasure. The interface is intuitive, allowing you to browse dishes, add
                            them to
                            your cart and check out without any worries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TypeScript played a big role in this project, ensuring type safety and making the code more
                            maintainable and error-free. This ensured that the application worked reliably and
                            efficiently,
                            improving the overall user experience.

                        <p>
                            This project demonstrates how Angular can be used to build a practical, real-world
                            application
                            with a focus on user interaction and functionality. Take a look and see how easy it is to
                            order
                            food!

                        <p>
                            Welcome to my chat app project! It's a nice little app that I put together using a bunch of
                            cool
                            technologies: React, Node, Express, Socket.io, and TypeScript. The idea was to create a
                            simple
                            and flawless communication experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the front end, I used React to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. It's
                            clean,
                            easy to navigate and great to use. On the back end, I used Express running on Node.js, which
                            made setting up the server logic a breeze. The magic of real-time communication happens
                            thanks
                            to Socket.io, thanks to which the chat is instantly updated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also added TypeScript to the mix to add type safety and improve code maintainability. It
                            was a
                            bit of a learning curve, but worth it for the added reliability and readability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application with a focus
                            on
                            real-time functionality, combining modern front-end techniques with a solid back-end
                            infrastructure. Try it and see how smoothly it works!
